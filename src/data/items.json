The Cast iron plant quickly established itself across all of Europe as a ‘ubiquitous’ houseplant thanks to its robustness and uncomplicated care requirements, and enjoys a reputation as an indestructible houseplant. The leafy plant is often used as decoration in offices, restaurants and stores in particular (which is why it is often sometimes known as the bar room plant). Its long leaves are also used by florists as foliage ornamentation.",

Most species of the genus are native to the tropics and subtropics —from the Canary Islands across Africa and Asia to Australia. The botanical name is derived from the Greek word drakaina, which means something resembling a female dragon or snake. More than 100 years ago, a garden magazine pointed out the beauty and robustness of dragon trees. In our latitudes, a few species are well-known as houseplants and office plants with air purifying characteristics. The best-known representative of the genus is probably the Canarian dragon tree (Dracaena draco). One plant that is quite similar in its growth form is the cabbage palm (Cordyline australis). Botanically too, they are quite closely related.",
